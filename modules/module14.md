# Module 14 - Data owner policies (Azure Storage)

[< Previous Module](../modules/module13.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module >](../modules/module15.md)

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

A new feature of Purview is Policies, which enables you to secure your data estate from within the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal. This feature is in Preview as of July 2022.

Data access policies can be enforced through Purview on data systems that have been registered in Purview for scanning and data use management. This feature allows Data stewards and owners to grant read, write access to various data stores from within Purview by creating a data access policy through the Policy Management app in the governance portal, enabling a single dashboard view of all access granted to all systems.

A **policy** is a named collection of policy statements. When a policy is published to one or more data systems under Purview’s governance, it's then enforced by the system. A policy definition includes a policy name, description, and a list of one or more policy statements.

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription.
* An Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Account (see module 00) in same subscription.
* A Azure SQL DB account in same subscription.
* A Microsoft Purview account (see module 01).

## :dart: Objectives

* Register data source for data use management
* Create data owner access policy for Azure Storage

## 1. Configure permissions for policy management actions

To make a data resource available for policy management, the Data Use Management (DUM) toggle needs to be enabled. A user, who will manage the policies in Purview, will need certain IAM privileges on the resource and MS Purview in order to enable the DUM toggle.

1. Grant IAM privileges to the user on the storage resource. Navigate to the **Access Control (IAM)** page of the storage account resource. Click on **+ Add** --> **Add role assignment**. Grant either of the following IAM role combinations:
    * Owner
    * Both Contributor and User Access Administrator

     ![Grant Contributor privilege](../images/module14/14.02-contributor-role.png)

     ![Grant User Management privilege](../images/module14/14.03-user-management.png)  
  
2. Grant roles to the same user in MS Purview. In Purview grant the same user **Data Source Administrator (DSA)** and **Policy authors** role at the root collection level. Navigate to **Collections**. Click on the root collection. Click on **Role assignments**

     ![Grant policy privilege](../images/module14/14.05-policy-role.png)

3. Enable Data Use Management. After a source is registered, edit the source. Set the **Data Use Management** toggle to **Enabled** as shown below.

    >
    > **DSA** role can publish a policy.  
    > **Policy authors** role can create or edit a policy.
